        <h1>Energy Conservation</h1>

        <p>Energy conservation is the practice of decreasing the quantity of energy used. It may be achieved through
            efficient energy use, in which case energy use is decreased while achieving a similar outcome, or by reduced
            consumption of energy services. Energy conservation may result in an increase of financial capital,
            environmental value, national security, personal security, and human comfort. Individuals and organizations
            that are direct consumers of energy may want to conserve energy in order to reduce energy costs and promote
            economic security. Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximize
            profit.</p>

        <p>Electrical energy conservation is an important element of energy policy. Energy conservation reduces the
            energy consumption and energy demand per capita and thus offsets some of the growth in energy supply needed
            to keep up with population growth. This reduces the rise in energy costs and can reduce the need for new
            power plants and energy imports. The reduced energy demand can provide more flexibility in choosing the most
            preferred methods of energy production.</p>

        <p>By reducing emissions, energy conservation is an important part of lessening climate change. Energy
            conservation facilitates the replacement of non-renewable resources with renewable energy. Energy
            conservation is often the most economical solution to energy shortages and is a more environmentally benign
            alternative to increased energy production.</p>

        <h2>Energy Conservation by Country</h2>

        <p><strong>India:</strong> The Bureau of Energy Efficiency is an Indian governmental apex organization created
            in 2002 responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation.</p>

        <p><strong>Japan:</strong> [Content for Japan can be added here based on your needs.]</p>
