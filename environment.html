        <h1>Environmental Issues in India</h1>

        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        <p>Air pollution in India is a serious issue with major sources being fuelwood and biomass burning, fuel adulteration, vehicle emissions, and industry. Air pollution contributes to various health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata often face hazardous air quality levels.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>India has a rich biodiversity, but it is under threat due to deforestation, habitat loss, and climate change. Conservation efforts in India include the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and conservation projects like Project Tiger and Project Elephant. However, more stringent measures are required to protect endangered species and ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Weather Issues</h2>
        <p>India faces extreme weather conditions due to climate change, such as severe droughts, floods, and heatwaves. These conditions have a significant impact on agriculture, water supply, and public health. The monsoon season, which is crucial for the country's agriculture, has become increasingly erratic, leading to both floods and droughts in different regions.</p>

        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>Water pollution in India is a major concern, with major rivers like the Ganges and Yamuna being heavily polluted. Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage are the primary contributors to water pollution. This contamination leads to waterborne diseases and negatively impacts aquatic life.</p>

        <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
        <p>Noise pollution is another environmental issue in India, particularly in urban areas. Sources of noise pollution include traffic, industrial activities, and public events. Prolonged exposure to high noise levels can lead to hearing loss, stress, and sleep disturbances.</p>

        <h2>Land Pollution</h2>
        <p>Land pollution in India is mainly caused by improper disposal of waste, including hazardous materials, plastics, and electronic waste. Urbanization, industrialization, and improper agricultural practices also contribute to soil contamination. Land pollution affects soil fertility and can lead to loss of agricultural productivity.</p>
